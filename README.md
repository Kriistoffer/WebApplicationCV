# My personal website

This project is for my personal website, and this is my first static website written in React.js. This website is still under construction - there are 
many ideas floating around my head on what I'd like to do and how I'd like it to work. Limited due to time and experience in JSX those ideas will have to
take form over time as I tackle and solve each problem.

## Components used
Here are the external components I've used in my projects that are published by other people. Be sure to check them out!

TypewriterEffect: https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-typewriter-effect
